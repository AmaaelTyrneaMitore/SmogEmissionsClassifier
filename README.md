# Smog Emissions Classifier 🏎️💨

A logistic regression-based model 📈 predicting vehicle pass/fail for smog emissions checks 🏎️ 💨. Analyzes weight, horsepower, & displacement for eco-friendly 🌿 driving assessment.

## Overview 🔭

The project focuses on building a model that categorizes vehicles based on their potential to pass or fail smog emissions tests. Utilizing logistic regression with gradient descent, this classifier aims to aid in eco-friendly driving assessments by predicting a vehicle's emission performance.


## Features 🌟

- **Data Exploration:** 📊 Analyze vintage car data, understand trends, and preprocess information for modeling.
- **Logistic Regression:** 📈 Utilizes a gradient descent algorithm for classification.
- **Evaluation:** 🧪 Assess model accuracy, tune parameters, and validate results.
- **Visualization:** 📉 Display visual insights and regression analysis results as graphs. Graphs will be generated in `png` format inside the `data/` directory.
